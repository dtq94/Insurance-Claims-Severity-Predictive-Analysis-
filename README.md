# All State Insurance Claims Prediction

## Overview
All State, a personal insurance company in the United States, aims to predict the severity and cost of insurance claims following unforeseen events. This ensemble machine learning project utilizes Python and various data science packages to predict the severity of insurance claims for All State.

## Tech Stack
### Language
- Python

### Libraries
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: Numerical computing
- seaborn: Data visualization
- matplotlib: Data visualization
- sklearn: Machine learning algorithms and tools
- shap: Model interpretation and explanation

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 100+ categorical and continuous variables, with the loss variable as the target variable. It provides a comprehensive view of various factors influencing insurance claims severity.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into the dataset through visualization and statistical analysis to understand relationships and patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection**: Utilize ensemble machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost to build predictive models.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics and techniques such as cross-validation.
6. **Model Interpretation**: Utilize SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret and explain model predictions, providing insights into the factors influencing insurance claims severity.
